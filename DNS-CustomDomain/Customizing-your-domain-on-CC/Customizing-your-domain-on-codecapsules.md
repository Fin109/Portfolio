# Customizing Your Domain on CodeCapsules

## Why a custom domain

Custom domains garner name recognition for your web-application. Take Google. The URL "www.google.com" is instantly recognizable. Typing in the address, you are taken to Google's search engine. Without a domain, you would need to type in the [IP](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a32729384/how-to-find-ip-address/) address for www.google.com

The web-address www.google.com is a placeholder to help us remember the website. When typing a URL in your search bar, your computer sends a request to the Domain Name System (DNS) - a series of servers located worldwide containing domain names and corresponding IP addresses.

When phone books were still widely used, one found a person's phone number by searching for their name and corresponding phone number in the book. Requesting a domain from the DNS behaves similarly. If your computer doesn't already have the IP address saved (or "cached"), your computer sends a request to the DNS with the domain you are searching for. The DNS then returns the corresponding IP address, and you connect to the website.

Although CodeCapsules provides a default domain, the domain is generic and probably doesn't look as appropriate as a personal domain would. Let's change that. This tutorial will guide you through buying a domain name and associating it with your CodeCapsules hosted web-application. You'll also learn a bit more about the DNS and related topics along the way.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- A web-application hosted on [CodeCapsules](www.codecapsules.io).
- A valid payment method (credit card, PayPal, cryptocurrency, bank transfer) to purchase a custom domain.

Let's get started!

## Where to buy domain

Accredited businesses that sell domains are called domain registrars. We will purchase a domain from www.gandi.net. Domains that aren't extremely desired usually aren't too expensive - I purchased mine for $8.97. 

### Purchasing a domain from Gandi

To purchase a domain on Gandi:

1. Navigate to www.gandi.net.

2. Enter the domain you want in the domain search box - I searched for "lincolnportfolio.co.za".

3. Add the domain to your shopping cart.

4. Checkout by clicking the shopping cart at the top right of the screen.

5. Pick how many years you would like to host the domain, and press the Checkout button.

Gandi will prompt you to log in or create a new account. Create an account and follow the payment process to purchase your domain. After purchasing, you can view your domain. Do so by:

1. Logging in to www.gandi.net.

2. Press the "Domain" button on the dashboard.

If Gandi has processed your domain, find it under the "Active" tab - if it is still processing, you can view it under the "Pending" tab (mine took 20 minutes to process).

Before routing your domain to your web application, we have one final step to complete. 

## Setting up HTTPS for your domain.

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. When you see HTTP before a web address such as http://www.google.com, you know that the information retrieved from entering this address is returned in [clear text](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/cleartext). This means your data is vulnerable when interacting with this website.

HTTPS is HTTP with S - secure. HTTPS encrypts data that is sent between you and the server you are connected to. Setting up HTTPS is quick with Gandi and is good practice regardless of the information your web-application is exchanging with its users.

To set up HTTPS with your domain you need to register a free SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate. In short, an SSL certificate helps encrypt the data sent when connected via HTTPS.

To register an SSL certificate for your domain:

1. Click on your new domain under the active tab.

2. Navigate to the "Web Forwarding" tab.

3. Click "Create" at the top right.

4. From the address drop-down menu, choose "HTTP:// + HTTPS://"

5. Type "www" in the text-box to the right. 

6. From the "Address to forward to" drop-down menu, choose "HTTPS://"

7. Type in the name of your domain. 

8. Choose "Permanent" under "Type of web forwarding"

9. The above image shows an example form - click create when done.

10. Repeat this process, this time choosing "HTTP://" for step four and typing "*" for step five.


This will forward any users connecting to your domain with `http://www.yourdomainhere.extension` or `http://yourdomainhere.extension` to `https://yourdomainhere.extension` - it forces your users to use HTTPS. By creating this forwarding address, Gandi also automatically creates an SSL certificate. This can take some time to process. 

To view this verification process, navigate to "SSL Certificates" on the Gandi dashboard. Soon you will receive an email from Gandi with a link asking you to verify your account before receiving the SSL certificate. Click the link you receive. 

Now that your domain has an SSL certificate, you can route your CodeCapsules web-application to your domain. Navigate to the "Domain" tab on the Gandi dashboard, and click on your domain name. Click the "DNS Records" tab at the top of the page and continue to the next section.

## Routing your web-application to your new domain

DNS records contain information about your domain. When a user enters your domain in their search bar, their computer will receive these records. When creating a new domain with Gandi, various DNS records are supplied with default values. For this tutorial, only the entries with type "A" and "CNAME" are important.

An A record stores the IP address of the server where your web-application is hosted (in this case, CodeCapsules). When you type in your domain name, your computer requests the A record associated with your domain from the DNS server. The DNS returns the A record containing the IP address, and you connect to your web-application. To change the default A record to route to your web-application:

1. On [CodeCapsules](www.codecapsules.io), navigate to the Capsule you wish to route to your new domain on.

2. Click Overview.

3. Press "Add A Custom Domain".

4. Copy the supplied IP address and type in the name of the web-address you purchased (mine was lincolnportfolio.co.za)

5. Click "Create Domain".

6. At the DNS record tab in domain view on Gandi, edit the entry with "A" as the type.

7. Enter "@" for its name and paste the CodeCapsules supplied IP address in the IPv4 address text box.

8. Click create.

View your web-application by typing `https://yourdomainname.extension`, replacing your domain name with "yourdomainname" and your extension (such as .com) with ".extension".

Notice that if you type `https://www.yourdomainhere.com`, you will receive a 404 error. To fix this, we will need to add a new "CNAME" record. A CNAME is like an alias for your domain. The best way to understand how CNAME records work is by creating one.

To allow users to enter in "www." before your domain name:

1. Return to CodeCapsules and press the "Add A Custom Domain" button again.

2. Under domain name, enter `www.yourdomainname.extension`, replacing your name and extension appropriately.

3. Return to the DNS record tab on Gandi, and press "Add" at the top right.

4. Choose the CNAME type.

5. Enter "www" in the name text-box.

6. Type your default CodeCapsules web-application URL under "Hostname" (you can find this in the "Overview" tab in your web-applications Capsule).

7. Click create.

You can now view your web-application by entering either `https://yourdomainname.extension` or `https://www.yourdomainname.extension`!

## What next?

You've learned how to purchase, secure, and configure a domain, route a domain to your CodeCapsules application, and even a little bit about DNS. 

If you are interested, there is still a lot to learn about DNS. A fine place to start is by following this link: https://aws.amazon.com/route53/what-is-dns/
